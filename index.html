                </div>
                <p>I've been playing music since I was 13 years old, mostly drums. Since then I went to college and uni to study Music Performance. Following that, I began working as a session drummer.</p>

                </div>
                <p>My realtionship with web development is a short one. I've only made a handful of very basic projects, like in the examples above. I'm hoping this will become my new career once I've put the time and effort in.</p>

                <p>While I'm no longer working in the music industry, I still spend a lot of my free time practicing drums and going to, or taking in part, in live performances. Most recently practicing brush work and jazz playing.</p>

                <p>Having lived in Spain from 7 years old til 18 years old, I went to Spanish public schools, and ended up learning the language very quickly. However, having been back in England for 12 years, I'm quite rusty, so I've been praciting by using Duolingo on my mobile.</p>
